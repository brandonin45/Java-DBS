# Java Database Management System (DBS)
This repo showcases the Java DBS that my team and I developed during my senior year of college (2020). The front-end was built using Java swing GUI library; Database connectivity was done with the JDBC API (Java database connectivity); Back-end database hosting was done with PostgresSQL. The purpose of this project was to develop a DBS that will allow other students to query names of businesses, services, restuarants, and other items of interst. The data that was used was a 2019 yelp review dataset.

## Functions
 * Connect to Postgres database that contains a polished yelp review dataset
 * Able to filter, query, and manage data
 * Highly customizable query options
